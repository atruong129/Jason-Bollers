#My project would look something like this:
![Alt text](https://github.com/imsd/Jason-Bollers/blob/master/images.jpg)

My idea is to make a scene that shows how many meteors crash into earths atmosphere each day.
All i need is to know eactly how many crash into earth each day, what speed, and how frequent.
Once thats done i just need to make the meteors and have them spawn in the frequency and speed
as the real thing, also add a field that destroys them when they get into the earths atmosphere
(also have to make a earth model).Most likely the data will come from nasa.
